<p>We are gearing up for what is to be a great <a href="http://jellyweek.tumblr.com/">JELLYWEEK 2013</a>. We will be participating with what will likely be over two hundred other groups of jelliers (is that a word?) and making history in the process.  <!-- more -->This is the first worldwide JELLYWEEK that we are taking part of under the guise of Athensworks, and certainly in our new space, but not the first for our group.</p>

<p>Facebook tells me that the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/304520699579540/?fref=ts">Athens Ohio Coworking</a> group was started a little over a year ago, and from that group came Athensworks.  We have been in &#8220;The Den&#8221; for a few months and we&#8217;re looking to show off our new digs.  JELLYWEEK 2013 is a great way to check out our coworking space in person, grab a desk, and spend some time jellying.</p>

<p>We will have the space open for free 10 AM to 3 pm Monday, January 14th through Friday, January 20th. Come say &#8220;Hi&#8221; or get some work done.  We&#8217;d love to meet you.</p>
